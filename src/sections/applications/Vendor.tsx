				<h4 className="app-sponsor-header">
					Please take the time to read ALL of the requirements listed below:
				</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Check-In</strong>: All units must check in at the parade staging area on the day of the parade. Check-in is required so that the parade committee may verify that all required information has been submitted and/or collected, provide you with any necessary last minute instructions or changes, line-up instructions, and give you your parade order assignment. Check in begins at 8 am, an you must be checked in by 9 am.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Change to Route</strong>: Route will begin at Walnut Canyon Elementary School, follow down Casey Road, and continue through High Street!
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Staging Area</strong>: Parade staging will be at Walnut Canyon
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Line Up</strong>: One of the things that Moorpark in particular enjoys is a very large and loyal crowd of watchers. You must remain in the same order as in the script or you will be announced under the wrong name and eliminated from judging.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">All Participants must be in the staging area at their assigned location no later than 9:00 am.</strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Line up information including placement and staging will be provided no later than Sept 27th.</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 className="app-sponsor-header">
					Thing to keep in mind:
				</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Closing up a Gap</strong>: You only need to slightly increase your step, still at a safe pace, in order to minimize a gap forming in front of you, or slow slightly to prevent a gap from forming behind you. No one â€“ not a gap monitor; police officer, nor safety, medical, or parade personnel should ever encourage you to run and catch up.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Stopping and Performing</strong>: In order for you to be able to stop along the parade route to perform, you need two things:
					</li>
					<li className="ml-[1.75rem]">
						Approval in writing from the Parade Manager and;
					</li>
					<li className="ml-[1.75rem]">
						Development of a routine with a 30 second Maximum. This is also the routine you can use when you are allowed to stop and perform at the Grandstands, for the judges. Longer stops and routines are discouraged, since they create lengthy gaps and add to the duration of the parade.
					</li>
					<li className="ml-[1.75rem]">
						<strong className="text-[white]">Never stop to perform for TV or other cameras!</strong>
					</li>

					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">Throwing or Handing Out Items to Spectators is Not Allowed</strong>: It is unsafe, unsanitary and a violation of Moorpark Country Days rules to distribute any items (food or non-food) during the parade. Violations of this rule may result in the immediate withdrawal of a unit from the parade and a one-year suspension from the parade.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Moorpark Country Days Committee reserves the right to revoke participation of any group or individual that offends community standards for conduct at a family-oriented event, or that could endanger participants or spectators.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong className="text-[white]">REQUIRED INSURANCE VERIFICATION</strong>: Insurance verification is required for all vehicles/drivers entered and for anyone with animals. If you are just walking in the parade you are not required to verify your insurance, although it is highly recommended as the event does not have any coverage for you. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					An email reminder will be sent out to all participants prior to the event.
